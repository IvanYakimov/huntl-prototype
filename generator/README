Generator provides only the generation of the input data without output for each test case in the
suite of function. As a result the thing what we call the “test skeleton” is created. The purpose and
brief description of the test skeleton is given hereinafter in this section.

Test Skeleton
The test skeleton contains information about funcitons under test. For each funciton is
specified its name, then after colon “:” character parameter value list and after “=>” symbol the
template of output parameters. At present, due to restrictions imposed on the prototype the hybrid
system generate the test skeleton in a fairly primitive form, but it will be expanded in prospective
studies.
